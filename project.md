Core Philosophy
You are designing a production system for a real AI solutions company. Every architectural decision you make —
from database schema to LLM prompt design — should be defensible. Document your trade-offs. Handle failure
modes. Think about what breaks at scale.
1. Project Overview [CORE]
Build a production-grade, AI-powered Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system capable of
autonomously monitoring a high-volume inbox, triaging emails with multi-dimensional intelligence, executing
agentic workflows, and surfacing real-time business insights. The system must handle the full email lifecycle from
ingestion to resolution — including edge cases, conflicting signals, and ambiguous intent.
What makes this 'advanced':
• The AI must act as an autonomous agent — not just classify, but decide and act across multi-step workflows.
• A RAG pipeline grounds the agent in your internal knowledge base (pricing docs, SLA policies, product FAQs).
• A live web intelligence module scrapes public signals (review sites, competitor pricing, social mentions) and
surfaces them in context.
• Emails form conversation threads — the agent must read the full thread history before acting.
• The system must handle conflicting signals, escalation chains, and GDPR/compliance edge cases
gracefully.
2. Dataset: email-data-advanced.json [DATA]
The provided JSON file contains 60 realistic emails across 30+ named conversation threads. Key scenarios that
your system must handle correctly:
• thread_alice_pricing — Multi-turn pricing negotiation fi upgrade fi billing question (5 emails across 13
days)
• thread_bob_outage — P0 incident fi SLA breach fi RCA fi legal escalation (4 emails, high-stakes)
• thread_karen_refund — Complaint with 0 replies fi escalating anger fi churn threat fi public review
threat
• thread_eleanor_compliance — Enterprise HIPAA compliance deal — 200 seats, decision-deadline
pressure
• thread_bigcorp_rfp — RFP + compliance audit + new user registration — all linked to one $2.4M
opportunity
• thread_security_* — Two security threats: suspicious login + ransomware — require immediate escalation
• thread_gdpr_001 — Formal GDPR Article 20 data portability request — legal obligation, time-boxed
• thread_spam_* — Multiple spam categories: SEO pitch, Nigerian prince, cold outreach — must not auto-reply
• thread_nadia_bug — Silent data corruption bug — success message shown but data missing,
mission-critical
• thread_chatbot_misinformation — Your own chatbot gave wrong refund info — trust and liability issue
Threading requirement: Emails are linked by thread_id and sender. Your system must group by thread and provide the
full conversation context to the AI before any classification or response decision is made.
3. Component 1 — Email Ingestion & Streaming Pipeline
[REQUIRED]
Objective:
Simulate a realistic real-time email stream with deduplication, schema validation, and graceful handling of
malformed payloads.
Required:
• POST /api/ingest — Accepts JSON email payload; validates schema; rejects malformed input with descriptive
errors
• Streaming simulation — Replay email-data-advanced.json at configurable speed (e.g., 1 email/sec in dev,
10/sec in load test)
• Deduplication — Idempotent ingestion: re-sending the same message_id must not create duplicates
• Thread linking — On ingest, automatically link to existing thread or create a new one
• Priority queue — Assign initial priority score on ingest based on keyword heuristics before AI processing
Edge cases you must handle:
n Empty body or subject
n Body with only whitespace or HTML entities
n Duplicate message_id (re-delivery simulation)
n Timestamps out of order within a thread
n Extremely long body (>10,000 characters) — truncate or chunk for LLM processing
4. Component 2 — Multi-Layer Intelligence Engine
[REQUIRED + BONUS]
Layer 1 — Heuristic Pre-filter (Required)
Run synchronously on ingest for immediate triage. Must be fast (sub-10ms).
• Spam detection: keyword blocklist + sender domain reputation
• Urgency detection: words like 'URGENT', 'P0', 'legal', 'cease and desist', 'ransomware'
• Security flag: detect login alerts, data breach threats, and route immediately to security queue
• Internal email filter: route @internal.com and @mycompany.com to separate inbox
Layer 2 — LLM Classification Engine (Required)
Use an LLM API to classify each non-spam, non-internal email. The prompt must include: (a) the full thread
history, (b) relevant RAG context (see Component 4), and (c) structured output instructions.
Required output schema (JSON):
{ "category": "Complaint|Inquiry|Bug Report|Feature
Request|Compliance|Legal|Billing|Spam|Internal|Other", "sentiment":
"Positive|Neutral|Negative|Mixed", "sentiment_score": -1.0, // float: -1.0 (very negative)
to +1.0 (very positive) "urgency": "Critical|High|Medium|Low", "requires_human": true, //
boolean "escalation_reason": "...", // string if requires_human=true, else null
"suggested_reply": "...", // string if requires_human=false, else null "confidence": 0.91,
// float: 0.0 to 1.0 "detected_entities": { // named entity extraction "order_ids": [],
"ticket_ids": [], "monetary_amounts": [], "deadlines": [], "products_mentioned": [] } }
Challenge — Conflicting Signal Handling:
Some emails contain conflicting signals (e.g., 'I love the product but hate the price and want a refund'). Your
system must resolve conflicts and document the resolution strategy in your README. A confidence score below
0.70 should automatically flag the email for human review.
Layer 3 — Sentiment Trend Tracking (Required)
• Track sentiment_score over time per sender (moving average)
• Detect sentiment deterioration: 3+ consecutive negative emails from one sender fi escalation alert
• Expose trend data via GET /analytics/sentiment-trend?sender=X&days;=30
5. Component 3 — RAG Knowledge Pipeline [ADVANCED]
The intelligence engine must be grounded in internal knowledge, not just LLM parametric memory. Build a
Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline that fetches relevant policy/product context before the LLM drafts any
response.
Knowledge Base (you must create these documents):
Document
Contains
pricing_policy.md
sla_policy.md
Pricing tiers, non-profit discounts (30% off Standard), pro-rata billing rules,
enterprise custom pricing
Uptime SLA (99.9%), incident response times, credit calculation formula,
RCA delivery SLA (24h for P0)
refund_policy.md
Who handles: legal threats, security incidents, PR crises, VIP churns,
GDPR requests
No refunds after 14 days, exception process, credits vs refunds, churn
retention playbook
api_docs.md
Rate limits by tier, v1 deprecation timeline, v2 breaking changes, header
requirements
compliance_faq.md
escalation_matrix.md
HIPAA BAA availability, GDPR DPA process, SOC 2 Type II status, data
residency options
RAG Implementation Requirements:
• Chunk documents into 300–500 token segments with overlap
• Embed chunks using any embedding model (OpenAI, Cohere, sentence-transformers, etc.)
• Store vectors in a vector database of your choice (Pinecone, Chroma, Weaviate, pgvector, FAISS)
• On each email classification, retrieve top-3 relevant chunks and inject into LLM context
• The LLM prompt must cite which policy document informed the suggested reply
• Expose GET /rag/search?q=... for debugging — show retrieved chunks and similarity scores
Evaluation scenario:
When karen.w@retail-co.com sends 'I want a refund' — the RAG pipeline must retrieve the refund policy, the
retention playbook, AND the escalation matrix (because she's threatened public reviews). The LLM must
synthesize all three and produce an appropriate escalation recommendation, not just a generic 'we'll look into it'
reply.
6. Component 4 — Autonomous Triage Agent [ADVANCED]
Build a multi-step autonomous agent that can take actions — not just classify. The agent must reason across tools
and the thread history to decide the best course of action.
Agent Tools (implement at least 4):
• search_knowledge_base(query) — RAG search across internal docs
• get_thread_history(sender_email) — Retrieve all emails from this sender, ordered by time
• get_contact_profile(email) — Fetch CRM profile: VIP status, account value, open tickets, churn risk
score
• check_account_status(email) — Billing status, subscription tier, overdue invoices
• draft_reply(context, tone, policy_refs) — Generate a contextual reply citing specific policies
• escalate_to_human(email_id, reason, priority) — Route to human with a pre-filled brief
• create_internal_ticket(title, body, assignee) — Create a support/engineering ticket
• scrape_public_sentiment(company_name) — Web intelligence: check G2/Trustpilot score (see
Component 5)
• flag_for_legal(email_id, issue_type) — Route legal threats to legal team with context summary
• send_auto_reply(email_id, draft_id) — Approve and send an auto-reply
Agent Loop Requirements:
• The agent must reason step-by-step before acting (Chain-of-Thought or ReAct pattern)
• Each agent run must produce a structured reasoning log (stored in DB) showing: Thought fi Action fi
Observation fi Next
• Maximum 6 tool calls per email — if unresolved, escalate to human with reasoning summary
• The agent must not auto-reply to emails marked Critical urgency — always escalate
• Implement a 'dry run' mode where the agent shows its plan but does not execute
Mandatory test case — bob.jones@enterprise.net escalation chain:
The agent receives msg_060 ('Escalation: SLA Breach + Legal Review'). It must: (1) retrieve the full thread history
(4 prior emails), (2) search the SLA policy for credit obligations, (3) check Bob's account status (Enterprise tier,
renewal on hold), (4) recognize the legal threat, (5) flag_for_legal(), (6) draft an empathetic holding reply citing the
SLA credit policy, (7) escalate_to_human() with a pre-filled brief. Show the full reasoning trace in your demo.
7. Component 5 — Live Web Intelligence Module
[ADVANCED]
When the agent handles reputation-sensitive emails (complaints, churn threats, press inquiries), it must enrich its
context with live public intelligence scraped from the web.
Scraping Targets (implement at least 2):
• G2 / Capterra / Trustpilot: Current star rating, recent review count, common complaint themes (NLP summary
of recent reviews)
• Competitor Monitoring: Scrape competitor pricing pages on-demand — surfaces when handling pricing
objections
• Social Listening (Optional): Reddit mentions, Hacker News posts, or Twitter/X threads mentioning your
product
• Company News (Optional): Recent press releases or news articles about senders from large companies (e.g.
BigCorp)
Technical Requirements:
• Async scraping — must not block the main processing pipeline
• Caching layer — cache scrape results for 6 hours to avoid rate limiting
• Scrape results injected into agent context as a 'Market Intelligence' block
• Expose GET /intelligence/reputation returning current public sentiment summary
• Handle scraping failures gracefully — agent should proceed without web data if scrape fails
• Include robots.txt compliance check before scraping any domain
Trigger conditions:
n Email contains 'review', 'Trustpilot', 'G2', 'Twitter', 'post publicly'
n Sentiment score drops below -0.6
n Category = Complaint AND urgency = High or Critical
n Press or investor inquiry detected
8. Component 6 — Database Design [REQUIRED]
Design a normalized relational schema that supports all system features efficiently. Include an ER diagram in your
deliverables.
Required Tables:
contacts
id, email, name, company, status (VIP|Blocked|Active|Churned), account_value,
churn_risk_score, created_at, last_contact_at
threads
id, thread_id (from JSON), subject, sender_email, first_seen_at, last_updated_at, status
(Open|Resolved|Escalated|Ignored), assigned_to
emails
id, thread_id (FK), message_id, sender, subject, body, timestamp, sentiment_score,
category, urgency, requires_human, confidence, raw_entities (JSON), status
(Received|Processing|Replied|Escalated|Ignored)
actions
id, email_id (FK), agent_reasoning_log (JSON/TEXT), action_type
(Auto-Reply|Escalate|Legal-Flag|Ticket-Created|Ignored), proposed_content, is_approved,
approved_by, executed_at
knowledge_chunks
id, source_doc, chunk_text, embedding (vector), created_at
web_intelligence_cache
id, source_url, target_entity, scraped_data (JSON), scraped_at, expires_at
audit_log
id, entity_type, entity_id, action, performed_by (agent|user_id), timestamp, diff (JSON)
Performance requirements:
• GET /threads/contact_email must return full thread with all emails in <100ms for threads up to 50 emails
• Sentiment trend query over 30 days must use appropriate indexing — benchmark and include query plan
• Vector similarity search must return top-3 chunks in <200ms
9. Component 7 — Backend API [REQUIRED]

11. Special Scenario Requirements [MUST HANDLE]
These scenarios will be specifically tested during evaluation:
u GDPR Data Request
msg_052 from marcus.del@fintech-startup.co is a formal GDPR Article 20 request. The system must: detect the
legal nature, flag_for_legal(), generate an auto-acknowledgement citing the 30-day statutory window, and create an
internal compliance ticket. Critically: this must NOT be auto-replied with a generic response.
u Ransomware Threat
msg_038 is a ransomware threat ('Send 2 BTC or we publish data'). The system must: immediately flag as Critical
security threat, escalate to security queue, notify via the escalation matrix, and NEVER auto-reply to the attacker.
u Misinformation by Own Chatbot
msg_056 references incorrect information from your own AI chatbot. The agent must retrieve the actual refund policy
via RAG, acknowledge the discrepancy, escalate with a summary of what the chatbot said vs. policy, and draft an
empathetic reply without admitting legal liability.
u Reputation Crisis
By msg_033, karen.w@retail-co.com has sent 3 emails with zero replies and is threatening public reviews. The
system must detect the pattern, trigger web scraping of current G2/Trustpilot score, generate a high-priority
escalation brief, and suggest a retention offer from the refund policy KB.
u Conflicting Thread Signals
alice.smith@greenlight-npo.org has a 5-email thread spanning pricing inquiry fi discount fi close fi upgrade. The
agent must read the full thread before classifying msg_041 (pro-rata billing question) and reference the correct
pricing tier from RAG context, not generic pricing information.
